# DATA221 – Assignment 3

Each question is in its own file.

- `DATA221_Assignment3_Question1.py`: Load data into DataFrame, calculate mean, median, standard deviation, minium value, maximum value, and answer the questions.
- `DATA221_Assignment3_Question2.py`: Load data into DataFrame, generate a histogram and a box plot, and answer questions.
- `DATA221_Assignment3_Question3.py`: Load data into DataFrame, split data into training data and testing data.
- `DATA221_Assignment3_Question4.py`: Using the split data sets in Question 3 to train a model using KNN. 
- `DATA221_Assignment3_Question5.py`: Using the split data sets in Question 3 to train the model with different number of k using KNN. 
- `Missing Data Calculator.py`: Calculates how many missing values are in `kidney_disease.csv`. When working on Question 3, I found that dropping every row with missing data would remove most of the rows, so I chose to **fill (impute) missing values** instead of deleting most of the dataset.
